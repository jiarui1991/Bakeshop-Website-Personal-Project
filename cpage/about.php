<div class="aboutleft">
Cherry's Bake Shop opened in July of 2007 on an (at the time) unlikely stretch of Sunset Blvd. We started with the idea of baking cakes, cupcakes, cookies, pies and bars that would be inspired by the bohemian modern esthetic of Silver Lake. The "look" of our baked goods would be stylized and simple, refined yet interesting. The taste; delicious and homemade.
<br><br>
We specialize in the rich, sweet and delicious. Whenever possible we use the freshest locally produced or distributed ingredients in our products. We crack our own eggs every day. We do not use liquid eggs or other food service shortcuts. We use gourmet chocolate and Dutch cocoa powder in our chocolate recipes and Madagascar Bourbon vanilla in our vanilla recipes.

We use California butter and pure cane sugar. Our dairy supplier is the Challenge Dairy Cooperative, a cooperative of more than 600 California dairies. We try to minimize our environmental footprint by using only compostable cups, clamshell boxes, utensils and straws. We also use paper bags and boxes whenever possible.
<br><br>
Cherry's Bake Shop is committed to serving the finest baked goods available and providing unmatched customer service. We look forward serving you!
