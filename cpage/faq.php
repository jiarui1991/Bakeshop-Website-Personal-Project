		<h2>Why are your cupcakes refrigerated?</h2>
		<div>
			<p>Because the majority of our cupcakes are made with perishable ingredients, they must be kept cold. While cold, the cupcakes are not as moist or creamy as they are at room temperature. We recommend that you allow the cupcakes to come to room temperature before enjoying them. This will allow the cake to return its natural moistness and the frostings to return their natural creaminess.
			</p>
		</div>
		<h2>How long can a cake or cupcake stay out unrefrigerated ?</h2>
		<div>
			<p>Circumstances will dictate, but we recommend no longer than an hour indoors and no more than a half hour outdoors.</p>
			
		</div>
        <h2>Do you sell gluten-free cupcakes?</h2>
		<div>
			<p>No. We make a flourless chocolate cake and cupcake but all of our products, including vegan and flourless products, are produced in a kitchen that uses nuts, eggs, dairy and soy.

		<h2>	Can I order special boxes of cupcakes or cookies for holidays?</h2>
		<div>
			<p>Yes. We offer both 6 cupcake and 12 cupcake boxes for various holidays. Boxes can be reserved in advance by calling or emailing. We also offer sugar cookie assortments for various holidays. The boxes and cookie assortments are also available for walk-in customers starting a few days before the holiday, while supplies last. 
			</p>
		</div>
		<h2>Can you custom decorate a cake? </h2>
		<div>
			<p>Yes. However, we ask to have a picture of the design you would like so we can create the exact cake you're expecting.</p>
			
		</div>
		<h2>Do I have to place an order or can I come into the shop and pick up a cake ?</h2>
		<div>
			<p>We make 6" and 8" cakes fresh daily in a variety of flavors for walk-in customers. However, there is no guarantee what we'll have on a day to day basis. If you need a specific cake, it is best to call ahead and place an order.
